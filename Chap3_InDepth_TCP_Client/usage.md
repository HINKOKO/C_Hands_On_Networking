## **Testing TCP Client program**

A pretty cool way to test this program is - of course to compile it before with `gcc` , e.g. running `gcc tcp_client.c -o tcp_client`, and then you can test by connecting to `example.com` on port 80 like so:

```
tcp_client example.com 80
```

Then send the following request

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

You must then send a blank line to indicate the end of your request, You'll receive finally an HTTP response back. Which will certainly look like

```
Configuring remote address...
Remote address is: 93.184.216.34 http
Creating socket...
Connecting...
Connected.
To send data, enter text followed by enter.

## **Testing our "microservice" of UpperCasing -> Server & Client**

First of all of course, we compile our microservice server program with gcc:

```
gcc tcp_microserv_fork.c -o server
```

Then, by opening two terminals, we are able to test the communication between client and server, and to test that our basic microservice works as expected, here's a screenshot of what we get:

## **Testing our chat server**

After compiling our `tcp_chat_room.c` file as usual, we can test it by opening 3 additional terminal in which we run our clients. <br>
In the following screenshot, the leftmost terminal ( the Most Significant Bit terminal ðŸ˜‚) is running our chat_server. <br>
The 3-right terminal are for Mary, Cindy and Brad, able to chit chat as showed, each one gets the messages send by the other and so on.
